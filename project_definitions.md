# consumer union

first mentioned here: https://chaos.social/@sofia/103030336816544180

similar to a workers's union. people getting together to discuss, organize and optimize their purchasing decisions.

unlike a consumer coop. it does not aim to run shops otherwise be a business entity.

# economics for anarchists

critical textbook for economics, covering mainstream economic theory as well as theories popular among anarchists, libertarians and socialists.

* featuring furry characters to represent different schools of thougt. to "humanize" different viewpoits. ;)
* it would be nice to have a format that can be transfered into a more interactive medium. like little defintion boxes that pop out when clickin on an economic term, and putting dialogues in a bit of an rpg- or visual novel like form

# universal keyboard

keyboard for writing, music and more.

## the status quo

* the irregular Halberstadt layout of musical keyboards is an artefact of times when keyboards were made to play just one diatonic scale.
* the staggered layout of typing keyboards has no ergonomic purpose, but are a remnant of machanical typrewriters, the rest of the keyboard is an accumulation of special functions that has accumulated over the years 

## the proposal

* blank keys arranged in a regular, orthogonal grid
* default 4 * 16 keypad for both, or a 4 * 8 keypad for each hand
* keybindings are application specific: and most application are not primarily concerned with writing, so using a letter-based keyboards for them is hacky.
* keybindings will be shown on screen by default. unlike keyboard shortcuts, these are just as approachable as normal toolbars. users accustomed to the application may choose to turn off the keybinding displays.
* modularity: keyboards should be able to lock together horizontally and vertically. this way they could also connect to touchpads, dial arrays, joysticks etc that should be similarly configurable
